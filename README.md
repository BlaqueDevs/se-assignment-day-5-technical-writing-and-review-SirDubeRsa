3. There are four methods to determine audience knowledge: direct inquiry of participants combined with audience surveys supplemented with preliminary assessments or assessments founded on available dataset information.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?

4. Content accessible to readers with limited technical ability will result from implementing plain language alongside context and term definitions along with examples and restricted use of professional jargon.
## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?

5. Using ordinary language over specialized terms in writing makes information easier to understand along with supporting diverse understanding and reducing misunderstandings.

## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?

8. Different technical information requires appropriate visuals that should include diagrams for structural elements or spatial arrangements together with charts for comparative analysis and flowcharts for workflow or process visualization.
## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?

9. Technical documents become easier to read and maintain organization through headings and subheadings because they break content into smaller sections while enabling readers to skim and scan the document and comprehend its structure.
## 10. What are some best practices for creating effective headings and subheadings?

10. When creating headings and subheadings people should adopt four practices: a) descriptive and concise language and b) consistent formatting with c) parallel structure and d) no abbreviations or jargon.
